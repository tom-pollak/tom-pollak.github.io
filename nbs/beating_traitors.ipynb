    "# Beating Traitors (BBC TV Show)\n",
    "\n",
    "Traitors is a fun national UK TV show, that is often lamented as having little to no information to go on, but is this True? I don't think so, with one key assumption:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Traitor do not vote for each other\n",
    "> \n",
    "> - With possible relaxation: _Unless the other traitor is successfully banished._\n",
    "\n",
    "This is because in the context of the show, the Traitors are working together, voting out your fellow Traitor (and failing) is obviously bad strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "From here we can create \"clusters\" of players that have not directly opposed each other, and can infer that at least one of these clusters incorporates all of the traitors.\n",
    "\n",
    "I represent this as a graph, starting fully connected between all players, and once a player votes against someone else, we remove the linkage.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can then cluster the graph into fully connected nodes. Nodes may be part of more than one cluster, but all traitors must be in at least one cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this is symmetrical, we only need the top half, and of course players don't vote for themselves so we don't need the diagonal either."
