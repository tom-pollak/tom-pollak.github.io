# Blender Copilot

> Why does the world needs another one "copilot"?

I'm making a new project, Blender Copilot. It's a pretty simple idea to be honest, but I haven't seen it been done before.

So in the coding scene we have all manor of coding assistants. I think this might be because the AIs are created by programmers, and what's the first thing we think of when creating it? How can it help me in my own work.

By contrast, I think there's probably less of an overlap between programmers and 3D artists.

The idea would be to make an extension that helps the artists be more productive, give initial designs quickly that they can refine. (Rather than wholesale replacement as we see with AI art). In my own experience with coding assistants, this works _way better_ than trying to replace the human outright. Working with Cursor is like having superpowers, but it still requires a human in the loop to guide / debug it.

Anyway I have an internal prototype, I'm writing this so I commit to share this in the coming weeks.
